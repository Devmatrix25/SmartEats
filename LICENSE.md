Version: 1.0 — Effective 2025

NOTICE: This is a custom open-source license created for the SmartEats – On-Demand Food Delivery Application. It grants broad rights to use, modify, and distribute the software while preserving author credit and restricting the sale of the software in unmodified form. Read the entire license to ensure compliance.

## 1. Definitions

- "Software" means the SmartEats codebase, documentation, examples, test suites, and other materials distributed under this license.
- "You" (or "Licensee") means any natural person or legal entity using, copying, modifying, or distributing the Software.
- "Original Authors" means the DevMatrix Team and the individual authors listed above.
- "As-is" means the Software in substantially the same form, structure, features, and behavior as it was originally distributed by the Original Authors, without Substantial Modification.
- "Substantial Modification" means changes that materially alter the Software's functionality, feature set, architecture, or user experience (for example: significant new or changed modules, new APIs, major behavior changes, refactors affecting system design). Whether a change is "substantial" shall be interpreted reasonably and in good faith.

## 2. Grant of Rights

Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, the Original Authors hereby grant You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable (except as provided below), perpetual license to:

a. Use the Software for any purpose, including personal, educational, research, and commercial purposes;  
b. Copy and reproduce the Software;  
c. Modify the Software and create Derivative Works;  
d. Distribute the Software or Derivative Works, in source or object form.

These rights are granted provided You comply with the requirements set out below.

---
## 3. Attribution and Redistribution Requirements

If You distribute the Software or any Derivative Works (in source or binary form), You must:

a. Retain this LICENSE.md file and any existing copyright notices in the distributed package.  
b. Include a clear, visible attribution to the Original Authors (DevMatrix Team) in the product documentation, README, About page, or equivalent location. Example attribution language: "Original SmartEats software developed by the DevMatrix Team (Trukoti Vinay, Sunny Kiran, Sathvik, Manimukthesh, Risheeth Preetham) — licensed under the SmartEats License (2025)."  
c. State clearly whether the distributed copy is the Original Software or a Derivative Work, and describe the nature of any Substantial Modifications made.

Failure to provide attribution or to retain this license text when redistributing is a breach of this license and terminates the granted rights.

---
## 4. Restriction on Selling As-Is

You are expressly permitted to sell software derived from the Software provided those copies are Substantially Modified and all other terms of this license are met. However:

- Selling, offering to sell, or otherwise commercializing the Software in unmodified or minimally modified form (i.e., "as-is") is prohibited.  
- "Minimally modified" includes changes limited to cosmetic edits, renaming, bundling without functional change, or configuration-only changes that do not materially change behavior or features.  
- If You intend to offer the Software commercially without Substantial Modification, You must first obtain specific, written permission from the Original Authors.

This restriction does not prevent charging for distribution, hosting, support, or maintenance for Derivative Works that satisfy the Substantial Modification requirement and comply with all other terms herein.

---
## 5. No Trademark or Publicity Rights

This license does not grant any rights to use the Original Authors' names, logos, service marks, or trademarks except as required to provide the attribution described in Section 3. Any other use of the Original Authors' names or trademarks requires separate prior written permission.

---
## 6. Patent and Sublicensing

- To the extent the Original Authors hold patents that they can license, no express patent license is granted by this document beyond the rights to use, modify, and distribute the Software as described above.  
- You may grant sublicenses to downstream recipients of Derivative Works provided those sublicenses include all obligations of this license, and the required attribution and license text are preserved.

## 7. Academic and Educational Use (SDC Course Guidelines)

This project is intended for academic and educational use consistent with the SDC course guidelines. By using or redistributing the Software for academic purposes, You agree to the following additional expectations:

a. Respect academic integrity: do not present the Original Software or Derivative Works that are predominantly unchanged as your own original work in assignments, projects, or assessments. Clearly disclose any use of SmartEats code in submissions.  
b. Follow the course's policies on collaboration, citation, and reuse. If the SDC course or instructors impose stricter requirements, those requirements take precedence for course work submitted to that course.  
c. For academic redistribution (such as class repositories, educational demonstrations, or course materials), include the attribution in Section 3 and retain this license.

These educational expectations are in addition to the license terms and are meant to foster responsible academic usage.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranty

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ALL DEFECTS OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES WILL BE CORRECTED.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF DATA, REVENUE, PROFITS, OR BUSINESS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

---
## 10. Termination

Your rights under this license will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. Termination does not affect the rights of downstream recipients who received the Software from You under a compliant distribution.

---
## 11. Miscellaneous

- If any provision of this license is held to be unenforceable, invalid, or void, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. The parties agree to replace any void or unenforceable provision with a valid provision that most closely approximates the original intent.  
- This license shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Original Authors primarily reside, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. (The Original Authors are part of the DevMatrix Team.)
